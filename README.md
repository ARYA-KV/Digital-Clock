# Digital-Clock
Digital clock using javascript
The website is a simple digital clock webpage. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and whether it's AM or PM. The design is minimalistic, with a large digital clock displayed in the center of the page against a black background. The clock updates every second to reflect the current time.
The website uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling (including font size, color, and font family), and JavaScript to dynamically update the time displayed on the webpage without requiring a page refresh. It also utilizes the Bootstrap CSS framework for responsive design and layout.
Overall, it's a straightforward and functional webpage designed to provide users with a real-time display of the current time.
